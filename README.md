# NumPy-Showcase-with-synthetic-data
This google colab notebook demonstrates practical NumPy patterns on synthetic data, independent of any specific ML model.

Sections:

Arrays, broadcasting, boolean masks
Monte Carlo Ï€ approximation and vectorized random walk
Linear regression from scratch (normal equation and gradient descent)
k-means clustering from scratch (vectorized E-step/M-step)
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on a synthetic signal
All examples are self-contained and require only NumPy and Matplotlib.

## Try it out in Google Colab as primarily built here!
